## What is Augmented Reality?

Augmented reality is made up of the word “augment” which means to make something great by adding something to it. So basically, augmented reality is a method by which we can alter our real world by adding some digital elements to it. This is done by superimposing a digital image on the person’s current view thus it enhances the experience of reality.
